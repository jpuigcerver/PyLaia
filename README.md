# PyLaia

**PyLaia is a device agnostic, PyTorch based, deep learning toolkit for handwritten document analysis.**

**It is also a successor to [Laia](https://github.com/jpuigcerver/Laia).**

Get started by having a look at our [Wiki](https://github.com/jpuigcerver/PyLaia/wiki)!
###### Several (mostly undocumented) examples of its use are provided at [PyLaia-examples](https://github.com/carmocca/PyLaia-examples).

## Installation

In order to install PyLaia, follow this recipe:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpuigcerver/PyLaia
cd PyLaia
pip install -e .
```

Please note that the CUDA version of nnutils ([`nnutils-pytorch-cuda`](https://pypi.org/project/nnutils-pytorch-cuda/)) is installed by default. If you do not have a GPU, you should install the CPU version ([`nnutils-pytorch`](https://pypi.org/project/nnutils-pytorch/)).

The following Python scripts will be installed in your system:

- [`pylaia-htr-create-model`](laia/scripts/htr/create_model.py): Create a VGG-like model with BLSTMs on top for handwriting text recognition. The script has different options to customize the model. The architecture is based on the paper ["Are Multidimensional Recurrent Layers Really Necessary for Handwritten Text Recognition?"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8269951) (2017) by J. Puigcerver.
- [`pylaia-htr-train-ctc`](laia/scripts/htr/train_ctc.py): Train a model using the CTC algorithm and a set of text-line images and their transcripts.
- [`pylaia-htr-decode-ctc`](laia/scripts/htr/decode_ctc.py): Decode text line images using a trained model and the CTC algorithm. It can also output the char/word segmentation boundaries of the symbols recognized.
- [`pylaia-htr-netout`](laia/scripts/htr/netout.py): Dump the output of the model for a set of text-line images in order to decode using an external language model.
